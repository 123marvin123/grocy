- Optimized relative time display (also fixed a phrasing problem for some languages, e.g. Hungarian) (thanks @Tallyrald)
- Fixed that stock entry labels on purchase were printed, even when "No label" was selected (was only a problem when running label printer WebHooks server side)
- Fixed that numeric and date-time sorting of table columns on the stock entries page did not work correctly (thanks @MasterofJOKers)
